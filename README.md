In this research, a smartphone-based obstacle detection
system for those with visual impairments is shown. It
records video in real time, uses a deep learning model to process
it, and then uses text-to-speech to deliver audible feedback. The
system does not require new hardware because it uses OpenCV
for video processing and a pre-trained object identification model
for recognition. Although it improves accessibility, issues with
processing speed, model correctness, and internet dependence
exist. Future developments will concentrate on enhancing offline
capabilities, cutting latency, and improving detection accuracy.
This project showcases an affordable and useful assistive technology
that helps visually impaired individuals navigate more
easily.
